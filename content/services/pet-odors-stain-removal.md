Along with stains, odor is a common problem.\n\nRemoving the pet odors from your carpet, such as urine can be a challenging and frustrating process. It's very important to have your carpet or fabrics treated as soon as an accident occurs to guarantee the success of complete stain removal. The longer a stain sits, the harder it can be to remove the stain completely. All of our services are backed by the PATHFINDERS Guarantee to leave your carpets, rugs and upholstery clean and fresh with complete stain removal in most cases.\n\nWe use a hypo-allergenic solution that is safe for you and your pets."

#### Pet Odor & Stain Removal

Most store-bought odor and stain removers can do more harm than good as they need to be spread liberally on the carpet, which can make the stain worse due to over-saturation.  These products can also result in mold growth in fibers and flooring in some cases. In severe cases, the pet urine can damage carpet padding, flooring and the slab or supporting wood flooring beneath your carpeting.

Our technicians will inspect your carpet padding and flooring to make sure there is no moisture or mold damage before treating stains and odors. All of our technicians are certified in mold and water damage restoration to give you the piece of mind the job will be completed properly.

Contact PATHFINDERS to schedule an inspection for our pet odor and stain removal services.
