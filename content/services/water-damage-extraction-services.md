### Our Water Removal and Water Extraction Process Includes:

* Extraction equipment is brought into the home to physically remove any freestanding water. Water is extracted from carpet, padding and upholstery.
* If necessary, carpet and/or padding may be removed for proper drying.
* Professional grade drying equipment is used to dry the affected areas and return the humidity levels in your home to normal.
* Proper water extraction and drying techniques help minimize the possibility of secondary damage and reduces costs.
* Pathfinderâ€™s service techs will monitor the drying process, and will reposition the drying equipment as needed throughout the process.

Once your home and belongings are dry, we put everything back where it belongs. If necessary, we even work directly with you and your insurance agent to process the insurance claim.
