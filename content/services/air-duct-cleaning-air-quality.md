We can also sanitize your system.

#### THE DUCT WIZARD CLEANING SYSTEM:

  
The Duct Wizard uses a unique, patented rotating dome shaped brush which is attached to a high powered vacuum nozzle. The vacuum runs continuously, and simultaneously vacuums the debris which has been dislodged by the rotating brush. This patented process makes the Rotobrush, the only system that can simultaneously brush and vacuum at the point of contact, and the most efficient system for residential, light commercial and marine air duct cleaning. Other duct cleaning technology uses a negative pressure method which consists of a large vacuum system that attaches with a hose to an access hole which has to be cut into the furnace plenum.

With the vacuum running the technician goes to each register and agitates inside the duct using various mechanical or manual tools. Theoretically, the debris is dislodged and is carried back through the whole system to the vacuum source.

The Duct Wizard contains both an active rotating brush, and a static ShopVac system. The ShopVac is used wherever topical vacuuming is required. For most internal air duct cleaning, the Duct Wizard vacuum hose is simply snaked through the duct system while the brush and vacuum do much of the work. The operator uses the new directional brush controls to guide the Duct Wizard through the duct work.  
The powerful yet flexible Duct Wizard cleans all types of air ducts including right angle turns, reducers and multiple bends in flexible and metal duct. You should consider having your air ducts cleaned if there is mold growth visible inside hard surface ducts or on other components of your heating and cooling system.

  
**There are many important things to understand concerning mold detection in heating and cooling systems:**

* Many parts of your heating and cooling system may not be available for a visible inspection, so ask a contractor to show you any mold that exists.
* A substance may look like mold but a positive determination of whether it is mold or not can be made only by an expert or a laboratory analysis. For around $50, some laboratories can tell you whether a sample sent to them on common household tape is mold or simply a substance that resembles it.
* Ducts are infested with rodents or insects.
* Ducts are clogged with excessive dust and debris and particles are actually released into the home from your supply registers.
