review = "6:00 PM on Monday night a pipe breaks under my sink and water was going everywhere. I was smart enough to turn the water off but what next!?! I called several places with no answer. Finally I left a message at Pathfinders Carpet Cleaning. I figured it was going to be another \"maybe call me back tomorrow\". within ten minutes I heard from a lady at Pathfinders Carpet Cleaning. I think her name was Bonnie and she told me she would have a crew at my home within 30 minutes. \n\nA guy names Chris showed up and I showed him my drenched kitchen, den and living room. I was ready to hear he'd be back tomorrow but that wasn't the case. He started extracting the water out of my carpets and told me his backup was on his way to help dry my house out. Those guys stayed working on my house till 10:00 PM extracting every bit of water out of my house. I was just finishing up repairing my broken pipe when Chris & his help were already putting their equipment back in their trucks. Yes I was totally freaked out but Pathfinders saved me that night. I won't look for carpet cleaning anymore. It will be Pathfinders for me for ever.\n\nPathfinders quick service saved me a frustrating evening and quite a bit of money because of their fast service. I'm going to call them back and request those same guys come out and clean all of my carpets. Thank you Pathfinders."

review = "If you are looking for a carpet cleaner don't waste your time or money with anyone else. Go straight to Pathfinders! I had my carpets cleaned on Monday by someone else and was sick with disappointment. They gave me a quote over the phone then gave me a much higher quote when they arrived. When I arrived back at home the carpet was wet but just as dirty as when I had left. I needed to find another cleaner but was very nervous. I didn't feel like I could trust anyone.   \nI called today and spoke to Bonnie at Pathfinders. She was so sweet over the phone and was able to send someone out today.   \nChris and Marvin did a great job. They explained everything and completed the job for the price I was given over the phone.   \nI will never consider any other carpet cleaner."

review = "I'm very happy with Pathfinders! They came out right on time, and were very nice, professional, and reasonably priced. We had two bedrooms, a hallway, and a formal living room that were done, and they were quick, and thorough, and my carpets look and smell great! I'll definitely be re-hiring these guys when we move out here in a couple of weeks to do the rest of the house. I highly recommend contacting them if you want the job done right."

review = "We have recently gotten a new puppy and it was not a shock when we ended up having a few accidents with the little guy! The young man Andrew that came and cleaned our carpets did an awesome job. Not only was he friendly and respectful, but he performed his duty very well. We are very pleased with the service we received and will be contacting this company again if we ever need these services in the future!"

review = "After multiple spills and messes on my carpets from my young messy kids, I decided to call Pathfinder's to deep clean them after many friends had recommended this company to me. They did an incredible job and made my carpets look brand new; Andrew Landon did an exceptional job and was a very polite and professional young man. I will definitely recommend Pathfinder's service and staff to my friends in the future."
