#### How Does Humidity Affect Carpet Cleaning?

During the [summer months](https://www.rmcarpets.com/news/how-seasons-affect-carpet-cleaning-drying-times), temperatures rise and the air becomes more humid. Nice for your vacation, but not so great for your carpet.

Steam cleaners use water — it’s [how they work](https://www.rmcarpets.com/steam-cleaning-explained/). That moisture then needs to evaporate from your carpet, and this only happens when the surrounding air is dryer than the carpet. When conditions are humid, the air can’t absorb much moisture — it’s fully booked already, so your carpet is going to take significantly longer to dry, and [drying is crucial](https://www.rmcarpets.com/why-steam-cleaned-surfaces-need-to-dry).

​

#### How Can You Prevent Humidity From Affecting Your Carpet Cleaning?

Run the air conditioning for around 4 hours before we arrive to steam clean your carpet — this will lower the room’s relative humidity. Keep it running as we work and for a minimum of eight hours after we leave. This works particularly well on cooler or wetter days when opening the windows isn’t an option.

That’s the best thing you can do, but it’s far from the only thing. Other tried-and-true tactics include:

* If you lack an air conditioner, open the windows to get air flowing through your home if weather permits. Open as many as possible to keep the air moving — you’ll replace humid air with dryer air.
* Don’t wait too long between professional [hot water extraction](https://www.rmcarpets.com/carpet-rug-cleaning-hot-water-extraction) cleanings. More water needs to be used when your carpets are heavily soiled. The more water that gets used, the longer it takes for carpet to dry.
* Turn on your ceiling fans if you have them. Ceiling fans can be a great way to keep the air circulating.

Follow those tips and you should find your carpet drying as quickly as possible. Just remember to wait until it’s dry as a bone before walking on it normally.

#### Prevent mold growth by drying water damage quickly

The sooner you start[ cleaning up after water damage,](https://www.angieslist.com/articles/tips-clean-your-flood-damaged-home.htm) the sooner you can stop mold from growing under your carpet.

The tools are simple: fans, bleach, and cleaners.

Red Cross officials say many homeowners can get rid of the mold just fine after a flood, but it will require a bit of elbow grease.

“It's mainly a matter of scrubbing,” [says Ken Garcia](http://www.newson6.com/story/29244289/experts-warn-flood-victims-to-clean-properly-to-avoid-mold-dangers) with the Red Cross Tulsa chapter. “It's kind of getting down on your hands and knees and really scrubbing.”

Exposure to mold can cause health problems for some people by irritating the nose, eyes throat, or lungs. Breathing airborne mold may trigger symptoms in those with hay fever, asthma, and allergies.

The best way to keep mold from spreading is to act fast when you know water is present. If you follow these six steps from [Ayoub Carpet Service](https://www.angieslist.com/companylist/us/va/chantilly/ayoub-carpet-service-%28acs%29-reviews-218254.htm) in Chantilly, Virginia, you should stay mold-free.

##### 1. Remove water as quickly as possible

Use a wet/dry vacuum to clean up as much water as soon as possible. These machines are the most effective tools for removing water and can be rented or provided by [water and smoke damage remediation companies](https://www.angieslist.com/companylist/water-and-smoke-damage.htm) that specialize in repairing residential flood damage.

##### 2. Use fans to speed up the carpet drying process

It can take several days for fans to completely dry a water-damaged area. The good news is that they also help circulate fresh air.

"When you think it's all nice and dry inside, it's not," Lipford adds. "Keep the fans going 24 hours a day for at least another week or so."

Homeowners can rent high-power drying fans from local home improvement stores with tool rental service.

##### 3. Use a dehumidifier to dry out the room

These machines remove excess moisture, which makes the air feel cooler and limits mold and mildew growth. Any equipment that helps dry out the air and the ground will speed up the drying time for your damaged floors and coverings.

##### 4. Steam clean carpet and flooring

Steam clean all carpets to properly sanitize and deodorize. Typically, water-damaged carpet padding must be replaced.

Replacing just the padding is much less expensive than having to re-carpet your entire home.

##### 5. Sanitize walls and baseboards

Anything touched by stormwater should be sanitized. Clean all walls, hard-surface floors, and other household surfaces with soap and water.

Sanitize them with a solution of 1.5 cups of chlorine bleach to one gallon of water. Remember to wear rubber gloves during cleanup.

##### 6. Check furniture

Look for water damage and remove furniture from wet flooring.

Water damage can easily be hidden underneath rugs or carpet, so be sure to give your home a thorough inspection if you suspect water damage.
