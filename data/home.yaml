introduction:
  heading: Why Choose Us
  body: Since 1976 we have been family owned, and operate out of the same location
    on Vista Rd. in Pasadena. Founded by my Grandfather, Paul Joe Candelaria, a Navy
    Veteran, he instilled honesty, reliability, and dependability from day one. We
    realize that choosing a company to come into your home and clean your belongings
    isn’t a easy one. We background check all our employees and make sure they are
    certified by the IICRC so they can provide you with honest and exceptional service.
